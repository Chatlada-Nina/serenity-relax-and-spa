# Serenity Relax&Spa
Serenity Relax&Spa is my fictional spa that I wanted to be my first project because I like to go to a spa and do a massage. The idea started with my interest in the massage & spa so I decided to make a website about it.

This website is for people who are interested in self-care, with chronic pain or muscle tension caused by lifestyle or occupational stress. Serenity Relax&Spa website provides all the informaition for the new and old users who need to know about the spa, spa programs, contact information and a booking form. 


## UX

My goal is to make 3 pages, Homepage, Spa programs page and booking form page so I started with sketching roughly out a homepage by hand in a paper and then created in more details in Balsamiq. In the end I created 4 pages, the additional page is the Success page which is essential to have in my website to make it clear to customers when they are booking. I want to make the website look clean and user friendly and have all the essential information.

### Colours Theme
Serenity relax&Spa page is a spa website so the colours I chose are warm and welcome tones which I used [Imagecolorpicker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) to generate colours from my main image so the colours theme goes great together with my image. Moreover, I used [WebAIM:Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/) to check the contrast of my colours to ensure they are easy to read for users.

### Typography
I wanted to keep my website simple and clean so I used 2 different font styles. My spa's name and the ending text in the footer, I used [Italiano](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/italiano) because It looks elegant and It is a hand-writing font style which makes it perfect for my pageâ€™s name and the rest of the text I used [Lexend](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend) because It intends to reduce visual stress and improve reading performance for the users. 
Additionally, I use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for my social media icons in the footer to help customers quickly and easily identify my social media sites.
