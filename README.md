# Serenity Relax&Spa

![The website shown on a variety of screen sizes](/documentation/readme/screen-responsive.png)

Serenity Relax&Spa is my fictional spa that I wanted to be my first project because I like to go to a spa and do a massage. The idea started with my interest in the massage & spa so I decided to make a website about it.

This website is for people who are interested in self-care, with chronic pain or muscle tension caused by lifestyle or occupational stress. Serenity Relax&Spa website provides all the informaition for the new and old users who need to know about the spa, spa programs, contact information and a booking form.

## UX

My goal is to make 3 pages, Homepage, Spa programs page and booking form page so I started with sketching roughly out a homepage by hand in a paper and then created in more details in Balsamiq. In the end I created 4 pages, the additional page is the Success page which is essential to have in my website to make it clear to customers when they are booking. I want to make the website look clean and user friendly and have all the essential information.

### Colours Theme
Serenity relax&Spa page is a spa website so the colours I chose are warm and welcome tones which I used [Imagecolorpicker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) to generate colours from my main image so the colours theme goes great together with my image. Moreover, I used [WebAIM:Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/) to check the contrast of my colours to ensure they are easy to read for users.

### Typography
I wanted to keep my website simple and clean so I used 2 different font styles. My spa's name and the ending text in the footer, I used [Italiano](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Italianno?query=ita) because It looks elegant and It is a hand-writing font style which makes it perfect for my pageâ€™s name and the rest of the text I used [Lexend](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend?query=lexen) because It intends to reduce visual stress and improve reading performance for the users. 
Additionally, I use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for my social media icons in the footer to help customers quickly and easily identify my social media sites.

### User stories
1. As a client, I need a simple and easy navigation and a user-friendly design that is a responsive layout for my device so I can find information easily and quickly.
2. As a new client, I want to see images and detailed information about the spa ambience and some of the available programs so that I can decide if It is the right place for me to give it a try.
3. As a new client, I need to find essential information about location, contact details and opening hours clearly and concisely so I can plan my visit or contact the spa.
4. As a client, I want to view all the programs in detail on the website so I can match my needs and decide which program I should do.
5. As a regular client, I want to book the service on the website so that I can reserve my date and time in my schedule.
6. As a massage lover, I want to see if there are special discounts for a member or any promotions, so I can decide if I want to be a member to plan my visit within my budget.
7. As a new client, I want to read testimonials from previous clients so that I can feel more confident about booking a program.

## Features left to implement

Testimonials/Customer Reviews
- I would like to add a textarea where users can write reviews. This section could help sit's owner improve the service and users get to share their experience to another users.

Sign up section
- I would like to add the sign up section after the testimonials in the home page and create a sign up form by using Bootstrap to create form similar to the booking form.


## Testing

Please refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file for all testing carried out.


### Bugs discovered

- CSS didn't work out for the first deployment
   - When I opened the first deployment in the new tab the website didn't show the style only the plain HTML so I edited the CSS link in HTML and removed the slash(/) to change that to a relative link. Now, all styles show up and work fine.

- The radio button in the Booking form didn't work properly
   - When I click on both radio buttons, they were selected both and can not undo it. I want users select just one button(new or old member)
   - I found out that I have different value for name attribute so to solve this issue, I needed to have a same name to radio buttons. Now It works properly as I wanted.

- During the deployment I have a temporary issue from Github which showed failed to deploy but not something cause by my code.
